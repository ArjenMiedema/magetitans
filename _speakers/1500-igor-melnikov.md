Page Builder is one of the biggest and most wanted features in Magento 2.3. I’m going to talk about what is does and explain it’s architecture and extension points.

## Talk Description
This presentation gives overview of PageBuilder (new Magento CMS) architecture: big picture, master format, data flow, configuration, main entities, different types of converters, etc.

Then it focuses on how 3rd party developers can use PageBuilder to bring merchants experience they want: how to customize PageBuilder by adding new content types and how to customize existing content types by extending them and using appearances.

Overview of data migration from BlueFoot to PageBuilder.

Extending PageBuilder best practices.

Overview of sample extensions developers can refer to when building their extensions.

Magento plans on Page Builder and PWA.

## {{ page.name }}
I started working with Magento 1 at 2009 as system integrator. I worked on different projects and customizations. In 2015 I joined Magento. At Magento I worked on page caching, dependency injection framework, date time API, persistence layer, content staging and security improvements. Currently I work as architect on Page Builder, new Magento CMS.

I like to talk and share knowledge about programming, architecture and Magento.
