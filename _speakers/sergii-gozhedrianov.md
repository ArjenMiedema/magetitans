## {{ page.title }}
I will do a talk about setting up a Magento CI environment for a headless setup and working with the community. I will 
tell about pitfalls and problems with existing setups, share my expirience within our community project at Deity and 
will describe test setups for 2 API's - REST and GraphQl.
