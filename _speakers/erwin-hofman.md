## {{ page.name }}
As front- and backend developer, started using semantic HTML when table-layout and frames were still hip and happening. 
Up to speed with frontend accessibility and (more important for revenue) pagespeed and performance. With this know-how, 
I am advicing companies and their e-commerces as well as building the fastest CMS driven websites.

As lead developer, also working for a GDPR related company, where I put my authorization, security and privacy knowledge 
to practice.
