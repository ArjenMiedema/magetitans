This small talk is about the fact, that nobody really cares about documentation if it's not an open source project. I've 
never seen a customer project writing massive amounts of useful documentation for their developers. Onboarding new team 
members is always a try and fail.

Nevertheless, there is a tiny little thing, called ADR's! An ADR is an architectural decision record that can be 
compared to a Git Commit message.

"An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting 
minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log." 
- https://adr.github.io/

ADR's are a lightweight form of important information about a project, related to a specific point in time. Therefore, a
 collection of ADR's can help to document a project with no effort.

In my lightning talk, I will explain how to handle it in practice and give examples.
