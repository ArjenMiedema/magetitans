## {{ page.title }}
A short insight into how Varnish caching and invalidation works, and how it can be improved.

A topic that is not written/talked about a lot: how is varnish cache built, how is it invalidated, how can it be 
improved and how can you debug it?

Examples: 
- adding entities to varnish cache-tags, like widgets 
- making varnish purge-requests async and greatly improve import- and indexing speed
