                Following registration of your interest on this website, event
                organisers will contact to let you know if your application has
                been successful or otherwise. Places at this event are limited
                and successful applicants will receive further information about
                the event once your place has been confirmed via a confirmation
                email.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unable to attend the event after confirmation has
                been received, please do let us know as soon as possible by
                emailing: <a href="mailto:groningen@magetitans.com">groningen@magetitans.com</a>. We do allow refunds, but
                only up to 24 hours prior to the event, this is so we can
                accurately estimate refreshments and seating.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you cancel any places after this date you will be charged the
                full amount and a refund will not be given. However, you may
                choose to instead send a replacement delegate; you are able to
                update your Eventbrite with the delegate’s name, there is no
                charge for this service. If, for whatsoever reason, you or your
                delegates do not turn up for the event (a “no show”) this shall
                be considered a cancellation. You will be charged the full
                amount for your place and a refund will not be given.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that we are not for profit; proceeds go to the event
                running and all excess to charity.
