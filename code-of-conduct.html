                Mage Titans, the Magento Developer Conference provides
                affordable and highly valuable learning opportunities from
                International Magento experts.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we want to protect the interests of the community, we have a
                few rules. We want to encourage attendees rather than scare them
                off by providing a harassment-free conference experience for
                everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mage Titans is not for the pitchers and the poachers. We don’t
                want developers or anyone else thinking that this is a
                recruitment drive. We want to create a relaxed atmosphere that
                allows for learning, sharing, nurture and encouragement rather
                than a high-pressured, business interview environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also discourage mentions of recruitment in our speakers
                talks, to ensure that all agencies involved are treated fairly.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, we have developed a Code of Conduct to ensure that
                attendees don’t feel hassled or harassed.
            </p>
            <p>
                All attendees, speakers and sponsors at Mage Titans are required
                to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
                enforce this code throughout the event to ensure an enjoyable
                experience for all. Regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
                disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. The same
                rule applies to place of work and employment history, as the
                attendees of this conference will be around their peers,
                friends, and competitors.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</li>
                <li>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.</li>
                <li>Be kind to others.</li>
                <li>Be polite.</li>
                <li>Do not insult or put down other attendees.</li>
                <li>Behave professionally.</li>
                <li>Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Mage Titans.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We ask all delegates and attendees to report any acts that
                violate this code of conduct. If we hear that someone has been
                hassling or poaching developers, then we shall ask them to leave
                the building.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for helping make Mage Titans a welcoming, friendly
                event for all.
            </p>
