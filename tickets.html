            <p>The Mage Titans are coming to Groningen for the first time!</p>
            <p>
                Mage Titans is open to all, it has something for every level of
                Magento developer. Learn new things and network with your fellow
                developers whilst enjoying a variety of presentations and panel
                discussions. There will also be an opportunity to provide feedback,
                so if there are any topics you’d like us to cover at future events,
                we want to know!
            </p>
            <p>
                We are a not-for-profit community event and each year, all profits
                after the organisation costs go to our chosen charity. This year we
                have chosen the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital Charity. We’re
                proud to support them in making a difference to the thousands of
                children they care for each year.
