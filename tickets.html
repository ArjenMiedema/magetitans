            <p>The Mage Titans are coming to Groningen for the first time!</p>
            <p>
                Mage Titans is open to all, it has something for every level of
                Magento developer. Learn new things and network with your fellow
                developers whilst enjoying a variety of presentations and panel
                discussions. There will also be an opportunity to provide feedback,
                so if there are any topics youâ€™d like us to cover at future events,
                we want to know!
            </p>

            <h2>New tickets available! Combine MageTitansGRQ with Reacticon</h2>

            <p>
                We added a new ticket type. It's now possible to combine this event with <a href="https://reacticon.org" target="_blank">reacticon</a>.
                There will be a clear difference in content on these conferences. Where reacticon will be focussed on react and frontend. MageTitans will be more
                backend (like talks about GraphQL) oriented.
                If you go to both conferences, you get a nice 18 euro discount. Also transport from the reacticon venue to MageTitansGRQ will be arranged.
            </p>
